# SWFSC Weekly Report - Week of October 28, 2024
Welcome to a new format of the weekly! As part of NMFS Openscapes Champions Fall 2024 Cohort, we are exploring how we can use github as a tool to generate the SWFSC weekly report! This is a draft and all feedback is welcome :) 

## Headline: 
Join us! “Get to NOAA Fish” pop up at the Oceanside Seafood Market  
This coming Sunday, the 20th of October at 11am, “Get to NOAA Fish” is teaming up with Chef Davin Waite for a seafood demo. SWFSC staff are welcome to join in the conversation with local fishing families and customers at the market. If you are interested in joining us, and as we evaluate the possibility of doing more of these going forward – contact Sarah.Mesnick@Noaa.gov.

# FIELDWORK:

## Ecosystem Science Division
Anthony Cossio and Caleb Flaim will drive a glider (“calanus” - formerly “george,” but was renamed out of  pure superstition that naming gliders after The Beatles cursed their deployments) from La Jolla, CA to  Humboldt, CA on October 15. Pending a good weather window that week, Tony, Caleb, Jacob Partida, and Eric  Bjorkstedt will deploy the glider in the area of the Trinidad Head Line for approximately one month. This is the  first deployment by ESD’s new Offshore Wind Program, led by Christian Reiss, and the goal is to collect  baseline ecosystem data in an area of proposed wind energy development. 

## Fisheries Resources Division
On Tuesday, October 1, Scott Mau and John Hyde (FRD), along with  
partners from CDFW, WCR, and PMRG, outplanted 300 white abalone  
in Point Loma. Two outplant modules that were left from the spring  
outplant were planned to be retrieved but one had to be left in place  
because one abalone does not seem to want to leave. The animal  
appeared very healthy. Large wild red and pinto abalone were also seen  
during the survey. Both canopy forming and understory macroalgal  
communities are looking very healthy, which is good for both wild and  
outplanted abalone.

## Marine Mammal and Turtle Division
*California Current Cetacean and Ecosystem Assessment Survey: CalCurCEAS 2024 aboard R/V Bold Horizon.  July24 – December 5, California Current – Reporting Period: October 2-8, 2024*
This week we covered 299.5  nautical miles of survey effort that included 168 sightings of 22 species (Figure 1). Our eDNA sampling has continued, collecting 11 samples (7 pre-determined  
stations and 4 targeted samples during sightings of rare species) and we successfully deployed seven DASBRs in planned locations. The first three were placed within the Eureka Wind Energy Area (WEA) providing valuable acoustic coverage of this previously under sampled region.

Title of paper: Using eDNA to supplement population genetic analyses for cryptic marine species: identifying  population boundaries for Alaska harbor porpoises 
Abstract from paper: Isolation by distance and biogeographical boundaries define patterns of population  genetic structure for harbor porpoise along the Pacific coast from California to British Columbia. Until recently,  inadequate sample sizes in many regions constrained efforts to characterize population genetic structure  throughout the coastal waters of Alaska. Here, tissue samples from beachcast strandings and fisheries bycatch  were supplemented with targeted environmental DNA (eDNA) samples in key regions of Alaska coastal and  inland waters. Using a geographically explicit, hierarchical approach, we examined genetic structure of Alaska  harbor porpoises, using both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data and multilocus SNP genotypes.  Despite a lack of evidence of genetic differentiation from nuclear SNP loci, patterns of relatedness and genetic  differentiation from mtDNA suggest natal philopatry at multiple geographic scales, with limited gene flow  among sites possibly mediated by male dispersal. A priori clustering of sampled areas at an intermediate scale  (eastern and western Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, and Southeast Alaska) best explained the genetic variance  (12.37%) among regions. In addition, mtDNA differentiation between the Gulf of Alaska and eastern Bering  Sea, and among regions within the Gulf of Alaska, indicated significant genetic structuring of harbor porpoise  populations in Southeast Alaska. The targeted collection of eDNA samples from strata within Southeast Alaska  was key for elevating the statistical power of our mtDNA dataset, and findings indicate limited dispersal  between neighboring strata within coastal and inland waters. These results provide evidence supporting a  population boundary within the currently recognized Southeast Alaska Stock. Together, these findings will  prove useful for ongoing management efforts to reduce fisheries conflict and conserve genetic diversity in this  iconic coastal species.
